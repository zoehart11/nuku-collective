            <h3>“How can fashion represent the fluidity
                of masculine and feminine energy?”</h3><p>As a Māori designer I discovered that since pre colonisation, 
                gender and sexual fluidity has always been in Aotearoa. 
                Takatapui is an ancient Māori term meaning 
                “intimate companion of the same sex” and today is used the 
                same way queer is used. Evidence of sexual fluidity are seen 
                in historical chants and carvings.</p>
               <p>
                 Using 100% recycled fabric,
                 I wanted showcase this fluidity of the masculine and feminine 
                 thats always been in Māori culture - and how sensuality can be 
                 expressed through all identities without being linked to sexuality.<br><br>
                 As I chose to express this concept through fashion design, 
                 I researched textile techniques and manipulations such as gathering, smocking, tucking, sculpture, and drapery. 
                 I wanted a technique that provided fluidity and sensuality
                in my collection. I discovered that the tucking technique allowed 
                fluidity and sculptural movement with fabric, so I manipulated and 
                implemented this technique into my five-piece collection.

        <p id="jordytext2" class="card card-tall card-wide">Connection to the land for me grows each time I come to a new place with something 
            new to offer and learn, but I draw a lot of energy from Te Wai Pounamu, having lived there for a good portion of my life.
             The land down there is heavy, with deep green blanketed all over and wild places in between. This strong, wild and diverse beauty
              of the land is where I find connection to my own strength and identity. I hope other wāhine can explore what these concepts / energies 
              mean for them and their connection to the land through my work. </p>

        <p id="jordytext1" class="card card-tall">The main textile techniques I work with consist of freeform crochet, hand painting / 
            energy scape painting and raranga / weaving. All of these techniques give me the opportunity to transfer energy between 
            me and the piece, physically moving my hands across the fabrication with intention uncovering the layers, forming an
             identity within the piece. This creation of visual energy / concept is really important for my process as I often 
             find it hard to articulate concepts and emotion clearly through words. 
      </p>
      <p id="jordytext2" class="card card-tall">
          My creative practice works within Te Ao Māori, encouraging interaction with strong female energies, opening spaces for conversations 
          around reclamation, celebration of body and identity; a journey for both creator and consumer.
