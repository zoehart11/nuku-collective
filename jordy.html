  <p id="jordytext1" class="card card-wide">I started Purple Mandarin over the first lockdown, March, 2020. As a kid I used to bead a lot, like 5 / 6 years old. When I got a bit older my uncle sent me heaps 
      of beads from singapore for my birthday and I would have beading birthday parties so it’s always been something I’ve really enjoyed and the over lockdown I rediscovered all the beads 
      again and I thought all that old stock sitting there was so silly and I should do something with it.</p>
  <div class="card card-wide"style="background-image: url(images/jordy1.JPG);"></div>
  <p id="jordytext2" class="card card-tall card-wide">I originally named the label Purple Gurls Pearls because I thought the play on words sounded fun. Then when I was trying to create a logo and brand myself a bit more
    I realised it was very gendered and I wanted it to be something more progressive because males and gender non-conforming people wear jewelry and everyone in between and it's not just girls and having 
    that word in my brand didn’t sit with what I wanted my business to be, so then I changed the name to Purple Mandarin, purple because I like the colour and its symbolic in the bisexual community, 
   and then mandarins are very symbolic in chinese culture and goodluck and prosperity which is part of my identity so the name is kinda a mixture of my identity.</p>

  <div class="card" style="background-image: url(images/jordy9.JPG);"></div>
  <p id="jordytext1" class="card card-wide">I started gaining an income that I didn’t have before and I just felt like other people needed it more than me. 
      So I started off donating 50% of profits to Women’s Refuge and I was able to fund 20 safe nights for women from the first few drops which felt really inspiring. 
</p>
<p id="jordytext2" class="card card-tall">After a while I realised 50% wasn’t sustainable for me in terms of needing to buy new materials as well as shipping costs. So I cut it down to 20% and each time I hit $200 that I can give away to a charity I choose a different one that inspires me.
    I’ve done one for planting trees, I also have a strong passion for Māori culture so I did one for the Ihumātao protest against Fletcher Building.

  <div class="card card-wide"style="background-image: url(images/jordy8.JPG);"></div>
  <p id="jordytext2" class="card card-tall">In terms of style, I just kind of use what I have in front of me and try to work with that, which is a challenge but keeps 
      things interesting because you're within a restriction and you just have to create what you can with it! I feel like a lot of businesses just buy the beads they want,
       they are on trend then just make heaps of the same product, which is all very repetitive. It’s exciting because I run out of material and I have to use other stuff so each time the necklace is going to be unique.
