    <p id="jordytext2" class="card card-wide">Kia ora! My name is Bella and I’m an Ōtepoti based 
        graphic designer and illustrator! I’m an artist at heart, and creativity is my greatest 
        tool for communication and self-expression. Through my design practice, 
        I aim to create subversive and thought-provoking work. My designs are quite often informed
         by my experience with genderqueer identity and sexuality. I believe design is one 
         of the greatest tools for breaking down social barriers and changing the way we think!  
  </p>

  <p id="jordytext1" class="card card-wide">I started Enby Collective as my major graduate project in my design communication degree. 
    I wanted to create a space for trans and gender-queer creatives to be celebrated, heard and uplifted. 
</p>
  <div class="card card-wide card-tall"style="background-image: url(images/enby2.jpg);"></div>

  <p id="jordytext2" class="card card-tall">The idea for Enby came about in a discussion between myself and my 
    flatmate who is also trans. We often have discussions about how as genderqueer people we 
    spend a lot of our time and energy educating people on why they should merely respect our 
    existence.
</p>
<div class="card card-wide card-tall"style="background-image: url(images/bellametalic.png);"></div>
<p id="jordytext1" class="card card-tall">I’ve always felt a real lack of compassion and empathy from the world - 
    people feel as if they have to understand us in order to say we shouldn’t be experiencing 
    violence or discrimination. So much of trans-liberation has been about educating others, 
    but we need spaces to feel appreciated, loved and celebrated.

  <p id="jordytext1" class="card card-wide">I designed and curated a publication that serves as an 
      anthology of trans identity, fashion, art and culture at the time each issue is made. 
      I wanted to create something that would excite the community and bring trans creatives 
      together. I also really just wanted it to be something that would comfort those who are
       struggling with navigating identity.
</p>

  <div class="card card-wide"style="background-image: url(images/enby13.jpg);"></div>
  <p id="jordytext2" class="card card-tall">I never really had something like this when I first
    started navigating my identity, so I want to provide that for others. Amazing trans 
    creatives from across the country contributed their art, experiences, poetry and more 
    to the publication. It’s honestly been such a beautiful and affirming experience for me 
    personally and I’m so excited to share it with my community!
